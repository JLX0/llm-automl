# ðŸš§ Under Construction

This repository is dedicated to integrating large language models (LLMs) with automated machine learning (AutoML) to streamline the process of solving machine learning tasks at the code level.

It is based on the research paper ["Large Language Models Synergize with Automated Machine Learning" (TMLR 2024)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RDEaIfOiJM).

The code is currently accessible [here](https://openreview.net/forum?id=RDEaIfOiJM).

We are working on releasing a friendly version of the code, complete with examples and detailed explanations, which will be available soon.
